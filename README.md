# A Tile Based Gamelab

We're experimenting with a tile based game engine.

The functions for making games are defined in `./engine/gamelab_functions.js`.

They are exposed globally in `./index.js`.

Check out the example games in `./games/`.

To run one of the games comment 
out the corresponding script tag in `./index.html`.


You can draw sprites using the pixel editor.

Go to `https://localhost:3000/pixel-editor`.

Draw your sprite and click print to get the sprite data string in the console.
