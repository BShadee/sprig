Some things to consider.

- How to restart games?
- How to describe win conditions?
  - all tiles of certain types match up

- How to check for patterns on top of one tile?
- What to do in the event of collisions?

- Whether there should be collision layers or just one solid layer?
  - What would the former enable?

- Is the concept of pushability neccessary?
  - Can it be covered by replacements, replacements don't have notion of motion
