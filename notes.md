Some things to consider.

- How to restart games?
- How to describe win conditions?
  - all tiles of certain types match up

- How to check for patterns on top of one tile?
- What to do in the event of collisions?

- Whether there should be collision layers or just one solid layer?
  - What would the former enable?

- Is the concept of pushability neccessary?
  - Can it be covered by replacements, replacements don't have notion of motion

  

- Only want to draw one map

- What special symbols are in replacement rules?
  - "." anything
  - "\_" nothing
  - "\_" could also mean nothing solid or background

- Is there some way of creating layers which only interact (match?) with themselves

- Is it better to be strictly 2d with one block in each spot at a time
  - ben's cursor in lights out wouldn't work
